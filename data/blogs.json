        "content": "Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. You use React Components to build user interfaces, and Next.js for additional features and optimizations. Under the hood, Next.js also abstracts and automatically configures tooling needed for React, like bundling, compiling, and more. This allows you to focus on building your application instead of spending time with configuration. Whether you're an individual developer or part of a larger team, Next.js can help you build interactive, dynamic, and fast React applications.",

        "content": "React, also known as React.js or ReactJS, stands as a freely available and open-source front-end JavaScript library designed for constructing user interfaces through components. Maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) along with a vibrant community of developers and organizations, React empowers developers to create single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications, often in tandem with frameworks like Next.js.\n\nReact's primary focus is on handling the user interface and rendering components to the Document Object Model (DOM). As such, React applications frequently incorporate additional libraries for tasks such as routing and client-side functionality. A notable advantage of React lies in its ability to selectively rerender only those portions of a page that have undergone changes, thus avoiding unnecessary rerendering of unchanged DOM elements.",
